# Shadow Weather App
### by GERVAIS Pierre (ExtraPerry)

This is a Unity project for proof of coding skill.
It's utility is as any other weather app's use for is. It is designed to work for Quest 2 VR headsets though can work with Steam VR thanks to the OpenXR plugin.

The app uses two APIs : http://ip-api.com & https://www.weatherapi.com which both have pretty good documentation in my opinion.
It also uses icons form both the Weather API stated above & https://www.flaticon.com.
One useful tool that was used was https://json2csharp.com that helped making classes for the API Model.

In the use case of this project and since unity doesn't really have any good way to import package dependencies as far as I know, all packages are included in this repo. So once cloned it should work out of the box in the editor.

The UI design is meant to be simple and easy to use with an example here (current) :
